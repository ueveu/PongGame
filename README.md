# **Classic Pong Game in Java**

![Gameplay GIF](assets/images/gameplay.gif)


### **Description**

This is my personal implementation of the classic Pong game using Java. This project was created to solidify my Java skills, focusing on object-oriented programming, GUI development, and collision handling. It also serves as a practical preparation for the Oracle Certified Foundations Associate, Java (1Z0-811) exam.

The game features two-player mode, adjustable paddle speeds, and a scoring system with a win condition. Players can restart the game once a winner has been declared. The project utilizes **Java Swing** to create the graphical user interface.

### **Features**

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend locally using separate keys to control each paddle.
- **Paddle Controls**: Player 1 uses W/S keys, and Player 2 uses the Up/Down arrow keys.
- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves smoothly across the screen, bouncing off the walls and paddles.
- **Scoring System**: The game keeps track of scores, and the first player to reach 10 points wins.
- **Win Condition and Reset**: When a player reaches 10 points, a win message is displayed, and the game can be reset with the "R" key.
- **Adjustable Paddle Speed**: Players' paddle speeds can be adjusted for faster or slower gameplay.

### **Optional Enhancements**

1. **Difficulty Levels**: Add different difficulty modes by adjusting the ball speed or paddle speed. This will allow players to choose between easy, medium, and hard modes.

2. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for actions like paddle hits, scoring points, and bouncing off walls. This will make the game more immersive.

3. **Game Menu**: Implement a start menu where players can choose to start a new game, view instructions, or adjust settings. This will make the game feel more complete.

4. **Power-Ups**: Introduce power-ups that appear randomly on the screen, such as larger paddles or speed boosts, to add more excitement to the game.

5. **Ball Speed Increase**: Gradually increase the ball speed as the game progresses to make it more challenging and intense over time.
